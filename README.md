# Browser Project Documentation
## Introduction
This is a Python project that aims to build a basic web browser using the tkinter library. The project allows the user to navigate the web by entering a URL and displaying the webpage in the browser window.

## Installation
To use this project, you'll need to install Python 3 and the tkinter library. You can download Python from the official website and tkinter should already be included with your Python installation.

## Usage
To run the project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```
python browser.py
This will launch the web browser window. To navigate to a webpage, enter the URL into the address bar and press enter. The webpage should then be displayed in the browser window.
```

## Features
Back and Forward Buttons

The browser includes a back and forward button that allows the user to navigate back and forth through their browsing history.

## Refresh Button
The refresh button allows the user to reload the current webpage.

## Address Bar
The address bar allows the user to enter a URL and navigate to a specific webpage.

## Future Development
In the future, we plan to add more features to this browser such as:

Bookmarks
Tabs
History

## Conclusion

This browser project provides a basic web browsing experience using Python and the tkinter library. We hope to continue developing this project and adding more features in the future.
